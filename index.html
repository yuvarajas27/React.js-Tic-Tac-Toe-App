  <!--         
    In React.js, usually first index.html file will be loaded, if visitor loads the web page, so, contents in index.html will be loaded along index.jsx file loaded from script tag.

    Usually our react components and logic will be present in index.jsx, that content will be rendered in root element by React as mentioned in  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />); in index.jsx , 
    But we can write html static content here in index.html file if needed, so here we are crearing some header tag contains image tag and heading tag.
  -->
  <header>
    <!-- Here, we are specifying the src attribute of the image as image name , not a file path of image with image name because contents present in public folder can be directly referenced in react project. -->
    <img src="game-logo.png" alt="Tic-Tac-Toe-Gaming-Board">
    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
  </header>

  <div id="root"></div>

  <!-- As Already Know, react injects script tags automatically in to index.html during production, here we are explicitly adding importing index.jsx file(here all our react component code logics present)
  
  here we are specifying type="module" in <script> </script> tag make sure that javascript file is treated as Javscript module, so this unlocks new syntax import , we can import and export scripts from all files we are loading here ,for e.g we can import scripts from A to B or export scripts from A to B, etc..

  <script type="module" src="/src/index.jsx"></script>
